# Gloomhaven Ledger

A digital character creation app for the board game Gloomhaven to streamline the campaign setup process and get players into the game without delay.

- Conceptualized the domain model, component hierarchy, and wireframe design of the application prior to coding.
- Optimized a Rails RESTful API backend with active model serializers to return digital game data and assets.
- Designed a user interface implementing React and Redux with Semantic UI React for styling.
